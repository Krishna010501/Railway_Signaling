#  Railway Signaling Simulation CLI (MNC-Level)

A modular, AI-integrated signaling simulation system for train control, fault detection, and real-time risk prediction. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and CLI-driven logic.

## 💡 Features
- Signal + zone simulation engine
- Fault and recovery prediction from log files
- ML-powered risk scoring (Low / Medium / High)
- Modular structure: `system_core/`, `ml_model/`, `notebooks/`, `logs/`
- Clean CLI with multi-mode execution
- GitHub & deployment-ready
